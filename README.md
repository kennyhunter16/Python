Python Programming
=================

Over the summer months, I will be teaching myself the basic, yet strong programming language Python. I will be uploading the code as I go. The code is used mostly as this point for reference in the future. I have learned C and Java in school already, so I wanted to see how easy and simple this language truly is. Wish me luck. 

Simple Programs
--------------
The following code in this folder are just simple little programs mostly used for reference for bigger code down the road. For example, if I want to remember how to use a certain function, I will write a code showing myself and you what it does. I hope the code helps me and fellow developers in the future.
